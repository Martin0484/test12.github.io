  <h1>Pronouns</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>We mentioned pronouns in the previous chapter and used them with verbs. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at pronouns that we used and then take a look at other types of pronouns.</h3>

  <h2>Tú vs Usted</h2>
  <h3>The difference between "tú" and "usted" is that "usted" is the formal way of saying "you" in spanish, while "tú" is the informal way of saying "you".</h3>
  <h3>Formal: Usted tiene dos hermanas. <span class="english">(You have two sisters.)</span></h3>
  <h3>Informal: Tú tienes dos hermanas. <span class="english">(You have two sisters.)</span></h3>
  <h3>"usted" is used when you are talking to someone like your boss, teacher, professor, or a stranger. "tu" is used when talking to someone like your sister, brother, mom, dad, or a friend.

  <h2>Ustedes vs Vosotros</h2>
  <h3>Ustedes seems like the plural version of "usted", but it's actually the plural version of "tu". "ustedes" is used when informally addressing a group of people. "vosotros" is the plural version of "usted" and is used when formally addressing a group of people.</h3>
  <h3>Formal: Vosotros estáis aprendiendo español. <span class="english">(You all are learning Spanish.)</span></h3>
  <h3>Informal: Ustedes estan aprendiendo español. <span class="english">(You all are learning Spanish.)</span></h3>

  <h2>Ellos vs Ellas</h2>
  <h3>If you are talking about a group of girls or women, you refer to them as "Ellas". Saying "ellas" is kind of like saying "those women" or "those girls". "Ellos" is used when you are talking about a group of boys or men. It is also used when a group consists of people from both genders. Therefore, saying "ellos" is kind of like saying "those men", "those boys", or "those people".</h3>
  <h3>When talking about women/girls: Ellas hablan español. <span class="english">(They speak Spanish.)</span></h3>
  <h3>When talking about men/boys: Ellos hablan español. <span class="english">(They speak Spanish.)</span></h3>
  <h3>When talking about people from both genders: Ellos hablan español. <span class="english">(They speak Spanish.)</span></h3>

  <h2>When the pronoun is the object</h2>
  <h3>The "subject" of a sentence is what performs the action of the sentence. The "object" of a sentence is what receives the action. For example, in "I love them", "I" is the subject while "them" is the object. And in "They love me", "They" is the subject while "me" is the object. "me" is the object form of "I", and "them" is the object form of "they". Here is the object form of each spanish pronoun:</h3>
  <div class="twoContainerSmall">
    <div class="twoSubSmall left"><h5>Pronoun</h5><h3>yo:</h3><h3>tú:</h3><h3>El/Usted:<h3><h3>Ella:</h3><h3>Nosotros:</h3><h3>Vosotros:</h3><h3>Ellos/Ellas<br>/ustedes:</h3></div>
    <div class="twoSubSmall right"><h5>Object Form</h5><h3>me</h3><h3>te</h3><h3>le</h3><h3>la</h3><h3>Nos</h3><h3>vos</h3><h3>&nbsp;<br>les</h3></div>
  </div>

  <h3>In english, pronouns that are in object-form go AFTER the verb. But in spanish, pronouns that are in object-form go BEFORE the verb. The pronouns below that are in object-form are highlighted in red.</h3>
  <h3>Yo te amo. <span class="english">(I love you.)</span></h3>
  <h3>Tú me amas. <span class="english">(You love me.)</span></h3>
  <h3>El maestro nos ayuda. <span class="english">(The teacher helps us.)</span></h3>
  <h3>Él les ayuda. <span class="english">(He helps them)</span></h3>
  <h3>Ella me está llamando. <span class="english">(She is calling me.)</span></h3>
  <h3>Yo la estoy llamando. <span class="english">(I am calling her.)</span></h3>

  <h2>Demonstrative Pronouns</h2>
  <h3>Here are some demonstrative pronouns in Spanish:</h3>
  <h3>esto <span class="english">(this)</span>, estos <span class="english">(these)</span>, eso <span class="english">(that)</span>, esos <span class="english">(those)</span></h3>
  <h3>Esto abre la puerta. <span class="english">(This opens the door.)</span></h3>
  <h3>Estos abren la puerta. <span class="english">(These open the door.)</span></h3>
  <h3>Eso abre la puerta. <span class="english">(That opens the door.)</span></h3>
  <h3>Esos abre la puerta. <span class="english">(Those open the door.)</span></h3>

  <h3>esto, estos, eso, and esos can also be used with nouns. </h3>
  <h3>The "o" in "esto" and "eso" needs to be changed to "e" when the word is used with a masculine noun and "a" when it's used with a feminine noun.</h3>
  <h3>Este hombre <span class="english">(This man)</span></h3>
  <h3>Esta mujer <span class="english">(This woman)</span></h3>
  <h3>Ese hombre <span class="english">(That man)</span></h3>
  <h3>Esa mujer <span class="english">(That woman)</span></h3>
  <h3>The "o" in "estos" and "esos" needs to to be changed to "a" when the word is used with a feminine noun, but the letter does not need to be changed the word is used with a masculine noun.</h3>
  <h3>Estos hombres <span class="english">(These men)</span></h3>
  <h3>Estas mujeres <span class="english">(These women)</span></h3>
  <h3>Esos hombres <span class="english">(Those men)</span></h3>
  <h3>Esas mujeres <span class="english">(Those women)</span></h3>
